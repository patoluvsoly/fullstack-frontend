Every summer for ten years they took a trip together, just the two of them, and it was perfect. Until it wasn't. Now they haven't spoken in two years and Poppy is miserable without him. So she convinces Alex to give it one more shot — one last trip to fix everything. But the thing she's been avoiding the whole time? That might be the only thing that actually can.",

There's a former spy, a nurse, a psychiatrist, and an ex-trade union activist, and between them they have more skills than most active detectives. When a real murder lands on their doorstep, they don't call the police first. They take notes. What follows is equal parts sharp, funny, and surprisingly moving — a mystery that reminds you that the most dangerous people in the room are often the ones nobody's watching.",

So he wanders New York City for two days — talking to strangers, getting into trouble, and raging at a world he finds unbearably phony. It sounds simple. But Salinger turns those two days into one of the most intimate portraits of a mind in pain ever written. Holden is frustrating and funny and heartbreaking all at once, and by the end you realise the person he's been hardest on the whole time is himself.",

A microscopic organism is feeding on the sun and dimming it, and Ryland is the only person left to stop it.

Against all odds they become inseparable, and what begins as friendship quietly becomes something neither of them has words for. But the war at Troy is coming, and prophecy has already decided how it ends. Madeline Miller takes the most famous story in Western literature and retells it from the inside — all the tenderness and the glory and the unbearable grief of loving someone the world has already decided is legendary. You know how it ends and you read it anyway. That's the whole tragedy.",

A dead man returns. A woman ascends to heaven while folding laundry. It rains for four years. Nobody bats an eye.
